In this program, I learned how to create a project in the virtual environment. First, I set up virtual environment with "venv" module, activated it with "activate" command, and then installed "requests" library. Then I created main.py file and wrote a script that greets a user and informs him or her about weather. At the end, I "requirments.txt" file where all dependencies are saved.
